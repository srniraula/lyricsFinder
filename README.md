# lyricsFinder


this project is used to find the lyrics of songs using genius api. sometimes when we're listening to songs in spotify or youtube music, there are no lyrics for some songs. In that case, this is helpful to find lyrics. 

There is one condition: the song has to be popular and name has to be unique. sometimes the api returns lyrics of another song. I tried to find using the artist name but also its missing, which is left for further refinement in this project. 

You can also use systemd to make this code run as background process in your system and whenever you press Ctrl + Shift + l, this popup appears and you can search lyrics by song name and artist name.
